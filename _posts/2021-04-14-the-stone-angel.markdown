The Stone Angel by Margaret Lawrence is a rare book both in its choice of protagonist and language. It is unifromly poetic with a rustic prairie charm peppered in. The range and depth of emotion can hardly be found in another novel. One can say, even Joyce and Woolf pale in front of this insightful treatment of old age and womanhood. So far, I have not been able to pick up reading pace because reading this book is like a slow walk through strange
Canadian woods and one has to stop and admire the tendrillous manifestations of lingusitic shoots.

The most touching moment in the first quarter of the book is when Hagar denies her brother's request to don their mother's shawl to comfort their dying brother. She has not seen her mother, she died birthing her, and cannot bring herself to put on the pretence of being her even though she loves her brother.
