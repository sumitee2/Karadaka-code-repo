**morning, dream**

If only we could make love in folds of sleep

before wakefulness brings its piercing eye, knowing 

glances, my shadow shaping your countenance.


<br>History, sterile behind the unmarred softness 

will soon with a nudge be on the wing

and wrest away from us this self-less harmony:



<br>the unreflecting tenderness of a mirror

in dark, the minutes of dramatic irony, an urge

tinctured of neither fulfilment nor love



**- Sumit Chaudhary**
